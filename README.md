# Right2Secure-Blog
I believe that privacy, security, and digital data ownership should be fundamental human rights and is not a privilege, every single person no mater (age, sex ,race, etc.) should be able to make the choice for them self's.
No single event motivated me to create this blog, in fact as a "private person" I want to avoid most attention from a public perspective. That being said I wanted a place to express my beliefs and give others that feel the same way another point of view.
I realize their are a lot of resources already out their some excellent and others questionable. I hope to expand, complement and debate them.

### My Intensions for the blog
I want a place where I can document my decisions to take control of my digital life and help others accomplish the same. I will attempt to focus primary on the following topics.

- Cyber Security
- Privacy Options
- OPSEC (Operational Security)
- Digital Ownership
